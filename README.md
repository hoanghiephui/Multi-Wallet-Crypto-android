# CoinHub Wallet

We dream of a worldâ€¦ A world where private property is untouchable and market access is unconditional.

That obsession led us to engineer a crypto wallet that is equally open to all, lives online forever and unconditionally protects your assets. Only the user is in control of the money.

It provides non-custodial crypto storage, on-chain decentralized swaps, institutional grade analytics for cryptocurrency markets, extensive privacy controls and human oriented design.
